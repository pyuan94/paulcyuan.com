										<p>
											Hi! I'm Paul and I'm a computer science graduate from the
											University of California, Davis. I have a passion
											for programming just about anything. However, my favorite classes during my college
											career were the lower-leveled focused classes such as Operating Systems and Computer
											Architecture. Something about how 1s and 0s get turned into functioning programs
											really fascinates me. Aside from that I also enjoyed my Web Design class because
											creating a functioning website by using front-end and back-end together was one of
											the most rewarding thing I did in college.
										</p>

										<p>
											I'm currently looking for a company where I can contribute to as well as
											learn more about programming. I'm an earnest student and I am looking for
											opportunities to pick up new skills as well as refine current skills.
											I have a lot of experience tutoring and explaining technical and abstract
											concepts to a variety of indivuduals. Been able to clearly communicate code
											in a digestible way is one of my strongest skillsets.
										</p>

										<p>
											Aside from programming, I enjoy playing a variety of video games, playing volleyball
											and cooking delicious food to eat. I'm always on the lookout for new types of
											foods to try out!
